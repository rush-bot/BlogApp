# BlogApp
Hi! Welcome to the Blog App.
This is an user friendly social media application that uses a UI to create a place where people can share their lives and interact with others. Users can create an account with an email, a username and a password. They can then create snd edit their posts once logged in. They can view all the posts people have made in their home page and view specific posts by clicking on the desired one. The user can also update theri profile image and their information in the settings and reset their passwords on the sign up page. This application is also built off of a django databse, which keeps track of all the registered accounts and every post that is created.


There are a couple of ways to run the application:

1. You can go to this link that takes you to the deployed application through Heroku. https://rushil-desai-blog-app.herokuapp.com/
